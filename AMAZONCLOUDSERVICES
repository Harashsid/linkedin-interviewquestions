What AWS services have you worked with?
Tell me about a recent task you performed using EC2.
How would you troubleshoot latency issues in an application deployed on EC2?
Explain IAM roles and policies. Can you create a custom policy? How?
How do NACLs differ from Security Groups?
If a Security Group allows HTTP (port 80) inbound but the NACL denies it, will the request reach the EC2 instance?
If an app fails despite an open Security Group, what would you check next?
Critical files were deleted from an S3 bucket. How could this have been prevented? How would you recover them?
How would you optimize rising S3 costs without deleting data?
When would you use Lambda over EC2, and vice versa?
CloudWatch vs. CloudTrail – Key differences?
Difference between ALB and NLB, when does latency matter more than routing logic?
hoose between EBS, EFS, and FSx for different workloads
Your autoscaler doubled the infrastructure costs. Logs are normal. What do you check?
S3 bucket deleted by mistake, walk me through infra + IAM prevention
How do you ensure that secrets used by a job running in a container are never logged or persisted?
 What’s the difference between Key Vault, Secret Manager, and Parameter Store — and when to choose what?
 How would you handle CPU throttling in a busy AKS/EKS cluster under payment traffic load?
 What are readiness gates in Kubernetes and when would you use them?
 Explain how you’d debug an issue where the HPA is not scaling pods despite high CPU usage.
 How do you ensure blue-green or shadow deployment testing for critical services?
Design a multi-region disaster recovery strategy for a microservices architecture with RPO < 1 hour and RTO < 15 minutes
Design a cost optimization strategy that reduced cloud spend by 40% without impacting performance
Design an autoscaling strategy that handles Black Friday traffic (10x normal load) while maintaining cost efficiency
