1. Your pod keeps getting stuck in CrashLoopBackOff, but logs show no errors. How would you approach debugging and resolution?

30. What types of Kubernetes upgrade strategies do you know? When should each one be used? Explain with respect to cost optimization and minimizing downtime.
31.How will you troubleshoot when users face latency in the pod?

32. You are the DevOps engineer handling production. The application works fine locally, but users complain of downtime. What steps will you take to troubleshoot this?
33.Let’s say your application is deployed on Kubernetes. What happens in the background when a user clicks the login button? Describe how the request flows through the Kubernetes components.
34.How does Kubernetes determine that a readiness probe is ready to take the traffic?
35. How do you prevent noisy neighbors?
36.Can you roll out config changes without restarting pods?
37. Do you know about taints and tolerations? If so, how are they used?
38.What are the use cases of ConfigMaps and Secrets? Can we attach them as volumes?
39. How does RBAC work? How does it connect with the user?
40. How do you give permissions to cluster-scoped resources? Which one is used?
41. What are health probes? Explain what they do exactly.
42.What are Kubernetes volumes and how do they work
43.What are storage classes in Kubernetes?
44.What is Ingress? Why is it used? Explain its workflow.
45. What do you mean by headless service? 
46.pod is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff, but the logs don’t show any errors. Where would you start debugging?
47.StatefulSet pod with a persistent volume isn’t coming back after deletion. How would you recover it without risking data loss?
48.The cluster autoscaler isn’t scaling up, even though some pods are in a Pending state. What would you check to understand why?
49.A network policy is unintentionally blocking traffic between services in different namespaces. How would you design and debug it to allow only the right communication paths?
50.One of your microservices needs to connect to an external database through a VPN inside the cluster. What would your architecture look like to ensure security and high availability?
